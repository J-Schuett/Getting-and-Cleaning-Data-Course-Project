## Study Design
The data was obtained from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip. The original data is split into "X_test.txt", "X_train.txt", "y_test.txt", "y_train.txt", "subject_test.txt" and "subject_train.txt", which we merge by concatenating the respective pairs (by their rows). Data that is used to rename the columns of X_test.txt/X_train.txt is extracted from "features.txt". Only this columns are considered that contain "mean()" or "std()"
The values of y_test.txt/y_train.txt are renamed using "activity_labels.txt".

In a second step the resulting data is summarized by grouping according to the subject and y values and then taking the average.

### Columns selected from X
tBodyAcc-mean()-X, tBodyAcc-mean()-Y, tBodyAcc-mean()-Z, tBodyAcc-std()-X, tBodyAcc-std()-Y, tBodyAcc-std()-Z, tGravityAcc-mean()-X, tGravityAcc-mean()-Y, tGravityAcc-mean()-Z, tGravityAcc-std()-X, tGravityAcc-std()-Y, tGravityAcc-std()-Z, tBodyAccJerk-mean()-X, tBodyAccJerk-mean()-Y, tBodyAccJerk-mean()-Z, tBodyAccJerk-std()-X, tBodyAccJerk-std()-Y, tBodyAccJerk-std()-Z, tBodyGyro-mean()-X, tBodyGyro-mean()-Y, tBodyGyro-mean()-Z, tBodyGyro-std()-X, tBodyGyro-std()-Y, tBodyGyro-std()-Z, tBodyGyroJerk-mean()-X, tBodyGyroJerk-mean()-Y, tBodyGyroJerk-mean()-Z, tBodyGyroJerk-std()-X, tBodyGyroJerk-std()-Y, tBodyGyroJerk-std()-Z, tBodyAccMag-mean(), tBodyAccMag-std(), tGravityAccMag-mean(), tGravityAccMag-std(), tBodyAccJerkMag-mean(), tBodyAccJerkMag-std(), tBodyGyroMag-mean(), tBodyGyroMag-std(), tBodyGyroJerkMag-mean(), tBodyGyroJerkMag-std(), fBodyAcc-mean()-X, fBodyAcc-mean()-Y, fBodyAcc-mean()-Z, fBodyAcc-std()-X, fBodyAcc-std()-Y, fBodyAcc-std()-Z, fBodyAccJerk-mean()-X, fBodyAccJerk-mean()-Y, fBodyAccJerk-mean()-Z, fBodyAccJerk-std()-X, fBodyAccJerk-std()-Y, fBodyAccJerk-std()-Z, fBodyGyro-mean()-X, fBodyGyro-mean()-Y, fBodyGyro-mean()-Z, fBodyGyro-std()-X, fBodyGyro-std()-Y, fBodyGyro-std()-Z, fBodyAccMag-mean(), fBodyAccMag-std(), fBodyBodyAccJerkMag-mean(), fBodyBodyAccJerkMag-std(), fBodyBodyGyroMag-mean(), fBodyBodyGyroMag-std(), fBodyBodyGyroJerkMag-mean(), fBodyBodyGyroJerkMag-std()

## Code book
Information about the original data can be found here http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones and in the README.txt file contained in the zip archive of the data. 
The features consists of a "SubjectID" of the test subjects (a number between 1 and 30), an "Activity" (one of the 6 values standing, sitting, laying, walking, walking_downstairs and walking_upstairs) and 68 features containing the mean and standard deviation of certain measurements obtained from accelerometers and gyroscopes. These features have numeric values that have been  normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
In the summarized dataframe "_mean" is added to the feature names (excluding "SubjectID and Activity).
